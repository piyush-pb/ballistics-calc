1. Import the math and numpy libraries.
2.Prompt the user to enter the following values:
The cross-sectional area of the bullet (in square meters).
The initial speed of the bullet (in meters per second).
The mass of the bullet (in kilograms).
The height of the bullet from the ground (in meters).
The distance of the target (in meters).
3.Calculate the time it takes for the bullet to reach its peak height using the formula t = sqrt((2*h)/g), where h is the height of the bullet and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
4.Calculate the distance traveled by the bullet using the formula x = (V0 * t) - (c * rho * A * (pow(v,2)) * (pow(t,2)))/(2 * m), where c is a constant value, rho is the density of air, A is the cross-sectional area of the bullet, v is the speed of the bullet, t is the time it takes for the bullet to reach its peak height, and m is the mass of the bullet.
5.Calculate the angle at which the muzzle should be inclined using the formula Q = ((numpy.arctan(J))*57.32), where J is the slope of the line formed by the bullet's trajectory and the ground.
6.Calculate the height at which the bullet will hit the target when it is parallel to the ground using the formula U = Y*tan(Q)*.017455, where Y is the distance between the bullet and the target and Q is the angle at which the muzzle should be inclined.
7.Print the angle at which the muzzle should be inclined and the height at which the bullet will hit the target when it is parallel to the ground.
